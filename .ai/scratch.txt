Create a VSCode Extension generates a code-link to github.
Given a line in their source-code and the user can "Generate Link". 
This will generate a URL link to the main/master remote repository and store it in their clipboard.
A message pop-up should appear.

Link example:
https://github.com/MrKou47/code-share/blob/master/src/genLink.ts#L105
github.com/MrKou47/code-share - This is the repo name
blob/master/ - this is the git branch
/src/genLink.ts#L105 - relative path to file and line number
